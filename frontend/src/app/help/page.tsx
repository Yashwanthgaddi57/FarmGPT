const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How does AgriGPT decide what to recommend?",
    a: "AgriGPT combines your saved farm profile (size, soil, water, crop, planting date) with live weather data, your crop-health scans, market prices with their sources, and your recorded expenses. Recommendations are generated from this data with the reason shown alongside each one.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are the profit numbers guaranteed?",
    a: "No. Cost, revenue and profit figures are estimates based on your inputs and typical conditions. Record your actual harvest in Farm Log and AgriGPT will show estimated vs actual — real outcomes from your own farm.",
  },
  {
    q: "Where do market prices come from?",
    a: "Live prices come from India's Agmarknet APMC feed (via data.gov.in) and always show source, unit and last-updated date. When the live feed is unavailable, AgriGPT clearly shows modeled estimates instead of inventing numbers.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I track what I spend?",
    a: "Open Farm Log → Expenses. Add each expense with a category (seed, fertilizer, labor…) and AgriGPT shows your total, per-acre cost and category breakdown, and compares recorded spending against your estimates.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I record a harvest?",
    a: "Farm Log → Harvest. Enter actual yield and selling price; revenue is calculated automatically and compared with your estimate on the 'Estimate vs Actual' tab.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can AgriGPT answer in my language?",
    a: "Yes — the copilot answers in English, Telugu, Hindi, Tamil, Kannada and Marathi. Set your preferred language in onboarding, your profile, or with the language switcher in the dashboard header.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is my farm data private?",
    a: "Yes. Your farms, scans, expenses and chats are stored in your own account and protected by row-level security. Only you can access them.",
  },
];
