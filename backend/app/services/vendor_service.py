"""Nearby agri-vendor discovery.

Sources merged, always sorted by TRUE distance (haversine km):
  1. Curated directory (`vendors` table, seeded with known agri-businesses)
  2. Live OpenStreetMap discovery near the farmer's pin (real local shops)

Sorting, display distance and radius filtering all use the same real distance.
Crop/category affinities are returned as flags — they are never baked into the
distance, so the UI can show honest "X km away" values.

OSM discovery runs at the farmer's chosen radius (capped for free-Overpass
stability); the nationwide curated directory covers beyond that cap.
